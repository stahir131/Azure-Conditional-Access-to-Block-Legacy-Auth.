### Block legacy authentication with Conditional Access

**What are Legacy Authentications**<br />
Also known as Basic authentication, it is a traditional method of verifying a user's identity that uses a username and password to access a system. <br />
Examples of legacy authentication include:<br />
* Microsoft Office 2013 or older.<br />
* Apps using mail protocols like POP, IMAP, and SMTP AUTH

According to Microsoftâ€™s analysis, over 97% of credential stuffing attacks and more than 99% of password spray attacks rely on legacy authentication protocols. Disabling or blocking basic authentication would effectively prevent these types of attacks.
